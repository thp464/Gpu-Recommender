# GPU Recommender

An interactive tool that helps gamers choose the best graphics card for their needs.

Users enter a list of games and a budget, and the tool recommends GPUs that can handle those games based on FPS benchmarks, VRAM requirements, and price-to-performance ratio. Built with Python and Streamlit, and designed to evolve into a full data warehousing and analytics project.

## Features
- Match GPUs to games based on VRAM and performance
- Filter results by price and resolution (e.g. 1080p)
- Warn users if their selections may exceed GPU limits
- Lightweight frontend with Streamlit for rapid interactivity
